# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React Native FlatList component fails to render data from a successful API call. The issue is intermittent and seems to be related to Android devices, with inconsistent behavior across different versions and devices.

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent` fetches data from a remote API.  The API call is successful, as confirmed by logging the response data. However, the `FlatList` consistently remains empty on certain Android devices, while functioning correctly on others and iOS devices.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on an Android emulator or physical device.
3. Observe that the FlatList might remain empty despite a successful API fetch.

## Potential Causes

* **Data Structure:**  An unexpected data structure from the API might cause the FlatList to not render properly.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Issues with asynchronous operations and how data updates interact with the render cycle.
* **Android Device Specifics:** Some underlying Android behavior might be interfering with the rendering process.

## Solution

The solution involves careful handling of asynchronous operations and ensuring the data structure aligns with the FlatList's expectations.  Refer to `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
